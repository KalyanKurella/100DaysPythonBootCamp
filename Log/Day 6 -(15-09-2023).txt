While Loop

Notes :

-> def keyword is used to create a function.
->function enables to code reusability
-> In while loop there should be logic which will make 
the while condition false and exit the while loop.
Otherwise it will end in infinite loop.
->tab contains 4 spaces
->using spaces is recommended than tab.But using 
tab is efficient.
